### Welcome to my weather app!!!
Hello friend, welcome to my repository and specifically my weather app project. This is a project inspired by greatstack, a youtube channel dedicated to coding, and readapted by myself. 

### Project Description
This repository contains a weather app built with html, css and javascript. Using google's openweather api, this app let's you enter a city's name and returns the city's corresponding weather. Any contributions, collaborations or criticisms with respect to this project are greatly welcomed 

Without any further ado, enjoy and happy coding!!!
